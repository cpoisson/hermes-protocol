Requirements
============

Pre-compiled wheels are available for Python 2.7+ and Python 3.5

The pre-compiled wheels supports the following platform tags :

* ``manylinux1_x86_64``
* ``armv7l``, ``armv6``
* ``macos``

If you want to install ``hermes-python`` on another platform, you have to build it from source.
