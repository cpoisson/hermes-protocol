About
=====

The ``hermes-python`` library provides python bindings for the Hermes protocol that snips components use to communicate together over MQTT.
``hermes-python`` allows you to interface seamlessly with the Snips platform and kickstart development of Voice applications.

``hermes-python`` abstracts away the connection to the MQTT bus and the parsing of incoming and outcoming messages from and to the components of the snips platform.

``hermes-python`` supports the ``snips-platform`` at version ``1.1.0 - 0.61.1``.
